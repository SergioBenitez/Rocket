Today marks the first major release since Rocket's debut a little over a month
ago. Rocket v0.2 packs a ton of new features, fixes, and general improvements.
Much of the development in v0.2 was led by the community, either through reports
via the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues)
or via direct contributions. In fact, there have been **20 unique contributors**
to Rocket's code since Rocket's initial introduction! Community feedback has
been incredible. As a special thank you, we include the names of these
contributors at the end of this article.
